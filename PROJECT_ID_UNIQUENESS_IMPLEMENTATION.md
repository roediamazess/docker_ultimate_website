# Project ID Uniqueness Implementation

## Issue
The current system allows duplicate project IDs to be saved in the database, which violates the requirement that project IDs should be unique.

## Root Cause
1. No database-level unique constraint on the `project_id` column in the `projects` table
2. Only application-level validation exists, which can be bypassed

## Solution

### 1. Database Level Implementation

Add a unique constraint to the `project_id` column in the `projects` table:

```sql
-- For PostgreSQL
ALTER TABLE projects ADD CONSTRAINT uk_projects_project_id UNIQUE (project_id);

-- For MySQL
-- ALTER TABLE projects ADD UNIQUE KEY uk_projects_project_id (project_id);

-- Create index for better performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_projects_project_id ON projects(project_id);
```

### 2. Application Level Implementation

The application already has validation in place:
- Frontend validation using AJAX calls to `check_project_id_uniqueness.php`
- Server-side validation in `projects.php` form processing

### 3. Files Modified/Added

1. `check_project_id_uniqueness.php` - Handles AJAX requests to check if a project ID already exists
2. `projects.php` - Contains server-side validation logic
3. `apply_project_id_unique_constraint.sql` - SQL script to add database constraint
4. `add_project_id_unique_constraint.php` - PHP script to add database constraint

## Implementation Steps

1. **Apply Database Constraint:**
   Run the SQL script `apply_project_id_unique_constraint.sql` on your database

2. **Verify Application Validation:**
   The frontend and backend validation should already be working:
   - When a user enters a project ID, it's checked against the database in real-time
   - When submitting the form, the project ID is validated again
   - If a duplicate is found, an error message is displayed and the form cannot be submitted

## Testing

1. Try to create a new project with an existing project ID
2. Verify that an error message is displayed
3. Verify that the form cannot be submitted
4. Try to create a new project with a unique project ID
5. Verify that the project can be created successfully

## Error Handling

If there are existing duplicate project IDs in the database:
1. Identify and resolve duplicate records first
2. Then apply the unique constraint

```sql
-- Find duplicate project IDs
SELECT project_id, COUNT(*) as count 
FROM projects 
GROUP BY project_id 
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

## Benefits

1. **Data Integrity:** Ensures project IDs are unique at the database level
2. **User Experience:** Provides real-time feedback to users
3. **Performance:** Index on project_id improves query performance
4. **Security:** Prevents data corruption through duplicate IDs
