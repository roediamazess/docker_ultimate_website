# Implementation of New Activity Data Structure

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of the new activity data structure as requested by the user. The changes include new fields, updated forms, and improved database schema.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Updates
- **Added new fields to `activities` table:**
  - `priority` (VARCHAR(20), NOT NULL, DEFAULT 'Normal')
  - `customer` (VARCHAR(100))
  - `project` (VARCHAR(100))
  - `created_by` (INTEGER, REFERENCES users(id))
  - `completed_date` (DATE)

- **Updated constraints:**
  - Priority field has CHECK constraint for values: 'Low', 'Normal', 'Hard'
  - All mandatory fields are properly marked as NOT NULL

### 2. PHP Logic Updates
- **Modified INSERT query** to handle all new fields:
  ```php
  INSERT INTO activities (information_date, priority, user_position, department, application, type, project_id, customer, cnc_number, completed_date, status, description, action_solution, created_by, created_at)
  ```

- **Modified UPDATE query** to handle all new fields:
  ```php
  UPDATE activities SET information_date=?, priority=?, user_position=?, department=?, application=?, type=?, project_id=?, customer=?, cnc_number=?, completed_date=?, status=?, description=?, action_solution=? WHERE id=?
  ```

- **Updated main SELECT query** to include `created_by_name` from users table:
  ```php
  SELECT a.*, p.project_name, u.display_name as created_by_name FROM activities a LEFT JOIN projects p ON a.project_id = p.project_id LEFT JOIN users u ON a.created_by = u.id
  ```

### 3. Form Updates

#### Create Activity Form
- **New fields added:**
  - Information Date (mandatory, default: today)
  - Priority (mandatory, selection: Low, Normal, Hard, default: Normal)
  - User & Position (free text)
  - Department (mandatory, selection from predefined list)
  - Application (mandatory, selection from predefined list, default: Power FO)
  - Type (mandatory, selection from predefined list, default: Issue)
  - Customer (free text)
  - Project (selection from projects table)
  - Completed Date (date picker)
  - Status (mandatory, selection from predefined list, default: Open)
  - Description (mandatory, long text)
  - Action / Solution (long text)

#### Update Activity Form
- **All fields from create form** are included with proper IDs for JavaScript population
- **Form is hidden by default** and shown when a table row is clicked

### 4. Table Display Updates
- **New table headers:**
  - No (auto-incrementing row number)
  - Information Date
  - Priority (with color coding)
  - Department
  - Application
  - Type (with color coding)
  - Description (with CNC number)
  - Status (with color coding)
  - Created By

- **Row click functionality:**
  - Each row is clickable and passes all activity data to `editActivity()` function
  - Removed action buttons (Edit, Cancel, Delete)
  - Removed checkbox column
  - Removed image from description column

### 5. JavaScript Updates
- **Updated `showUpdateForm()` function** to populate all new fields:
  ```javascript
  function showUpdateForm(id, project_id, description, cnc_number, status, type, due_date, information_date, priority, user_position, department, application, customer, project, completed_date, action_solution)
  ```

- **Updated `editActivity()` function** to handle all new parameters:
  ```javascript
  function editActivity(activityId, projectId, description, cncNumber, status, type, dueDate, informationDate, priority, userPosition, department, application, customer, project, completedDate, actionSolution)
  ```

- **Form management:**
  - `showCreateForm()` hides update form when called
  - `showUpdateForm()` hides create form when called
  - Proper form switching between create and update modes

### 6. Color Coding
- **Priority colors:**
  - Low: Green (bg-success-focus text-success-main)
  - Normal: Blue (bg-info-focus text-info-main)
  - Hard: Red (bg-danger-focus text-danger-main)

- **Type colors:**
  - Setup: Green
  - Question: Blue
  - Issue: Yellow
  - Report Issue: Red
  - Report Request: Primary Blue
  - Feature Request: Secondary Gray

- **Status colors:**
  - Open: Yellow
  - On Progress: Blue
  - Need Requirement: Red
  - Done: Green
  - Cancel: Gray

## Database Migration
- **Migration script created:** `migration_add_activity_fields.sql`
- **Fields added successfully** to existing database
- **Default values set** for existing records
- **Constraints applied** for data integrity

## Testing
- **PHP syntax check:** ✅ No syntax errors
- **Database connection:** ✅ Successful
- **Migration execution:** ✅ All fields added successfully

## Next Steps
1. Test the complete workflow (create, read, update activities)
2. Verify all form validations work correctly
3. Test notification system integration
4. Verify row-click editing functionality
5. Test pagination and filtering with new fields

## Files Modified
- `activity_crud_new.php` - Main application file
- `database_schema_postgres.sql` - Database schema
- `database_schema.sql` - Migration scripts
- `migration_add_activity_fields.sql` - Field addition migration

## Notes
- All mandatory fields are properly marked and validated
- Default values are set for better user experience
- Color coding provides visual feedback for different field values
- Row-click editing provides intuitive user interaction
- Forms are properly managed to avoid conflicts between create and update modes
